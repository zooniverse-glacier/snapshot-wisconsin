    content: '''
        Caracals are said to be nocturnal but are often seen during the day. Social behavior is limited to courtship and mating. They are extremely fast runners, labeled as the fastest cat of their size. They are also skilled jumpers, making vertical leaps several feet high to catch birds. When they hunt antelopes for food, they suffocate them with a strong grip on their throat or muzzle. The caracal produces a range of vocalizations including meows, growls, hisses, and coughing calls.

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
        Caracals breed year-round. After a gestation period of 62 to 81 days, females give birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Births peak during the rainy season. After 45 days, kittens start to eat meat and are fully weaned after four to six months. Kittens remain with their mothers for about a year.
