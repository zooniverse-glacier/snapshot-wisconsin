  description: '''
    There are two weasel species in Gorongosa: striped weasel (Poecilogale albinucha) and zorilla (Ictonyx striatus). The striped weasel is a small weasel with a long, sinuous body, very short limbs, and a long tail. They have black fur with a yellowish-white patch on the top of their head that splits into white stripes that run the length of their back and join again at their tail, which is all yellowish-white.

    A skunklike mustelid, the zorilla has long, shaggy, jet-black hair, with four wide white stripes that run from nape to tail. Their head is broad but blunt with an individual pattern of white spots between the eyes and a stripe on each cheek. Their tail and the back of their ears are also mostly white. Like skunks, the zorilla may emit a strong-smelling liquid from its anal glands when threatened. However, the smell is less pungent than that of a skunk.

    content: '''
      <p> Zorillas and striped weasels are nocturnal and solitary. They are most active after dark and then return to their burrows, which are often just a pile of stones, before dawn. Much of their time is spent searching for food by digging or sniffing out concealed insects, reptiles, and small mammals.</p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      <p>A solitary species, zorillas are usually only seen together when mating. They have a gestation period of 36 days, and females generally give birth to a litter of one to three young. Zorillas are born in the spring and summer, and are able to kill mice by around nine weeks old.</p>
      <p>After a gestation period of 32 days, striped weasels give birth to a litter of one to three young. The young are weaned at 11 weeks and will reach sexual maturity between 1.5 and 3 years of age.</p>
