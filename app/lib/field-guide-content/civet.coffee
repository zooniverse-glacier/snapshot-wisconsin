    The African civet has a raccoonlike appearance with a black streak across its face and white on the forehead surrounding its muzzle. Its coarse coat is dirty white in color, heavily spotted, and barred with black. They have a prominent erectile crest of black-tipped hair that runs from the head to the tail, and a wide head with a pointy muzzle, small eyes, and small, rounded ears. The African civet is the largest African member of the Viverridae family, which includes genets, civets, and linsangs.

    content: '''
        The African civet is a nocturnal species that is mainly active just before sunset until midnight, and around sunrise. During the day, females and cubs are known to sleep in a nest, while males will sleep in thick vegetation. Both sexes have large glands near their genitalia used to scent-mark landmarks within their territories. African civets are solitary animals; the only time they seem to be seen together is when they are mating. They are generally silent, but do growl deeply and cough when threatened.

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
        The African civet gives birth to one to four young after a gestation period of 60 to 72 days. The breeding season in southern Africa is from August to January, whereas on the east coast in Kenya and Tanzania the African civet breeds from March to October. Newborn African civets feed on their mother’s milk for around 6 weeks.
