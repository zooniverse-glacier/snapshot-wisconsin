  description: '''
    Nyala are medium-sized antelopes that exhibit extreme sexual dimorphism, with the two sexes appearing entirely different. Females and young are short-haired, bright rufous-chestnut in color, and have 12 or more vertical white stripes. They also have white spots on their face, throat, lower flanks, and thighs. Male coats are shaggy and turn dark-brown to gray with age. Males have fewer and less conspicuous stripes and spots. Both sexes have a white chevron between their eyes and a bushy tail that is black above and white underneath.

    content: '''
      <p>Nyala are generally found in groups of two to 30 individuals, with the most basic social unit being a female accompanied by her most recent offspring. Males also form groups, associating in twos and threes. They spend most of their day concealed in heavy vegetation. If threatened, they make a deep barking-like sound, and they will respond to the alarm calls of other nyala as well as those of impala, baboons, and kudu. Nyala are not territorial, and their home ranges overlap. Males will fight when breeding.</p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      <p>After a gestation period of seven months, one calf is born. Breeding takes place year-round, but breeding peaks in the spring. Young are born out of the sight of potential predators, and calves remain hidden for up to 18 days, during which the mother will return to nurse. A calf will stay with its mother until her next calf is born.</p>
