  description: '''
    The greater kudu is a large antelope that can be identified by the 6 to 10 thin, pale stripes against its tan to gray-brown body. They have a distinct white band across their face between the eyes. Males have long, spiral horns that can reach over a meter in length. Both sexes have a crest of hair that runs along the middle of the back and forms a mane. Females are noticeably smaller than the males.

      <p>The greater kudu is a sociable animal, living in herds of up to 25 females and their offspring. The larger males roam more widely and form loose bachelor groups, generally only joining female herds during the mating season. During the breeding season, the necks of the mature males will swell and aggression between males becomes more common. When males compete, they will stand with their mane erect in an attempt to appear bigger. These displays can develop into fights, with males locking their horns around the body of their opponent. In some instances the locked horns may become stuck and both males will die. When a threat is present, males will slowly sneak away, but when faced directly with potential danger they will flee rapidly.</p>
