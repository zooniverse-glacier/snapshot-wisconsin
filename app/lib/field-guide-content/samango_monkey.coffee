  description: '''
    The samango monkey is an Old World monkey that is unique in appearance with an unusually long tail. Despite its common name, the monkey does not appear blue in color, though some individualâ€™s may have a blue hue to their face. Their body is covered with a thick coat that varies in color depending on location and subspecies. Samango monkeys (C. m. labiatus), which range from east Zimbabwe and Mozambique to east Cape Province, have a dark-brown face, with white limited to their lips and chin. The fur on their upperparts is grizzled gray-brown, whereas their underparts are white and their legs, shoulders, and outer two-thirds of their tail are black.

    content: '''
      <p>Samango monkeys are diurnal and arboreal. They are a social species and often live in groups (or troops) of up to 40 individuals. Each troop contains one dominant (alpha) male, which dominates breeding with all females in the group. The alpha male will defend its troop against intruders, and females are known to join in when conflict erupts. When the dominant male of a troop is challenged by a conspecific male and a take-over happens, the former alpha male is often ousted from the group.</p>
