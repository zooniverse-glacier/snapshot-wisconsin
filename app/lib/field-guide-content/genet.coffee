  description: '''
    The large-spotted genet is a small carnivore that is catlike in appearance with soft, short fur. Their base color varies geographically but ranges from yellowish to gray with brown and black spots covering their body. They have a banded tail, a brown-black spinal stripe, and an indistinct dark patch on their face between the inner corner of the eye and the outer corner of the mouth, bordered by a whitish patch under the eyes and next to the nose.

      <p>Large-spotted genets are solitary, agile climbers that are active at night. They communicate using catlike vocalizations including purring, mewing, hissing, and spitting. They are considered arboreal and climb trees to hunt; however, they rest and take shelter on the ground.</p>

    content: '''
      <p>After a gestation period of about 10 weeks, females give birth to two to four young. Young open their eyes and ears after five to 18 days, they have their first pair of canine teeth by four weeks, and by 42 to 91 days they are able to eat solid food. Large-spotted genets are weaned by eight to 11 weeks, and juveniles are able to kill their first prey by about seven months of age.</p>
