  description: '''
    The plains zebra is the most common and widespread of the zebra species found in Africa. Zebras are horselike ungulates with distinctive black and white striped coats that make them one of the most recognizable animals. The stripes on the neck to the forelimbs are vertical and continue in the mane, which is short and erect. Stripes on the limbs are narrower and horizontal, if present. The tails are short and end in a tuft of black hair.  Crawshay’s zebra is a subspecies of the plains zebra that is found across a very limited range, including Gorongosa. You can tell Crawshay’s zebras apart from other zebras by their thinner and denser black stripes, which extend all across their underbelly and all the way down to the hooves; there are never shadow-stripes (thin, light-brown stripes between the black ones). They also appear to have slightly different teeth than other zebras.

    content: '''
      <p>Plains zebras are social animals, living in permanent family groups that are composed of one male, one to six females, and their young. Groups have a dominance hierarchy. Plains zebras are one of the most nomadic grazers, constantly in search of green pastures. The dominant female within the group hierarchy preserves her rank by leading the group in single-file movements, with other mares lining up according to their correlated rank. Foal rank depends on the mother’s rank within the group, and they will follow directly behind her when traversing landscapes. The dominant male always takes up the rear of the line, taking a defensive and protective role of the group in case of threat or attack by predators. During migratory journeys, several groups will often come together.</p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      <p>After a gestation period of about 12 months, females give birth to one foal. Weaning is complete after 7 to 11 months. After 16 to 22 months, foals reach sexual maturity but will not mate immediately.</p>
