    Sometimes people are captured in photos too, such as researchers checking the cameras, scouts on patrol, and tourists driving past in their vehicles. Humans and animals share Gorongosa, and while tracking human activity is not a focus of this project, it is still helpful for us to know if a photo contains a person.
