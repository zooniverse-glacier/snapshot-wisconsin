    content: '''
      <p>Impala are active night and day, alternating resting and grazing, and drinking at least once a day. Females and young form herds of 50 to 100 individuals that have a home range of about 2 to 6 [square?] kilometers. Sexually mature males form territories that vary in size from 0.2 to 0.9 square kilometers. These territories are marked with urine and feces. Males will attempt to keep female herds within their territory and defend them against intruding males. They use their long, spiral horns to challenge each other.</p>
