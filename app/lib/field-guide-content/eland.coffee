    content: '''
      The common eland is one of the most nomadic antelopes; females have home ranges of up to 500 square km. The social organization of the eland is somewhat different from that of other antelopes. The older the males, the more solitary they become, while younger animals may form small groups.

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      The common eland breeds year-round. After a gestation period of nine months, females will give birth to a single calf. Females with young calves come together in nursery groups. After the young are weaned at about three months, the mothers rejoin the female herds, and the calves remain together in the nursery group. Juveniles usually remain in the nursery group until they are almost two years old.
