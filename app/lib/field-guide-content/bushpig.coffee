  description: '''
    Bushpigs resemble the domestic pig, with blunt, muscular snouts, small eyes, and pointed, tufted ears. They are reddish-brown to dark brown in color and their fur becomes darker with age. They have a silver-colored mane, which bristles when they become agitated. Their sharp tusks are fairly short and inconspicuous. Males are normally larger than females.

    <p>Bushpigs are social animals that are found in groups of up to 12 members, consisting of a dominant male and female, with other females and juveniles. Bushpigs are highly territorial, and can be aggressive, especially when young are present. They are predominantly nocturnal. They seek shelter in dense vegetation and build nests during rainy and cold periods. In the heat, they wallow in the mud.</p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      A bushpig reaches sexual maturity at 18 to 21 months. Bushpig males exclude other males for access to a group of females. The males compete by butting heads. Most births occur between September and November. The female bushpig goes to their sheltered nest before giving birth. After birth, they nurse their young for 2 to 4 months. Parents usually drive out young bushpigs at 6 months of age.
