  description: '''
    Reptiles are cold-blooded, scaly-skinned vertebrates. Most reptiles lay leathery eggs; however, many lizard and snake species give birth to live young. The reptiles’ dry, scaly skin helps them retain water, making it possible for them to survive and thrive in typically inhospitable habitats such as deserts. However, they are absent from Antarctica. Reptiles comprise over 7,000 species worldwide, about 1,000 of which live in Africa. A third of the world’s reptiles are currently threatened with extinction. Use this option for all reptiles, including crocodiles, snakes, tortoise, and lizards.
