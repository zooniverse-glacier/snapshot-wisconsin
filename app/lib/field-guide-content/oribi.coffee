    content: '''
      <p>Oribi are commonly found in monogamous pairs or in groups of as many as seven individuals. Generally groups will only include one adult male. They will mark their territory with urine, feces, and secretions from glands around their eyes. Territories often overlap. If they are threatened, they will hide in tall grass until the predator is within a few meters, at which point they depend on their speed and agility to flee.</p>
