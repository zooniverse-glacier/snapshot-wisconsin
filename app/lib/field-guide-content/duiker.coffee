  description: '''
    There are three duiker species in Gorongosa: common duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia), blue duiker (Philantomba monticola), and red duiker (Cephalophus natalensis). Duikers have overdeveloped hindquarters, a long neck, and short legs that are well adapted for moving through forest undergrowth. Duikers also have erectile head crests, backward-tilting horns (both sexes), small ears, and bare nostrils. They are typically well-camouflaged against their habitat. Their mobile lips and long, pointed tongue allow them to easily eat from the forest floor.

    content: '''
        Duikers inhabit small territories, which they mark with secretions from glands that are located just below their eyes. Males will actively defend their territory. Males and females are generally found together in monogamous pairs. To avoid predation, these closed-habitat dwellers hide first and only make a quick getaway when immediately threatened.

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
        Duiker courtship includes a prolonged and noisy chase around the territory of a pair before they mate. Females give birth to a single offspring after a gestation period of 5 to 7 months. A calf is able to run within a few hours of birth and grows rapidly, reaching adult size between six and seven months.
