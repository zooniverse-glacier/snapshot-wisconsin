The upperparts of the body appear grizzled, while the underparts and limbs are whitish. Their ears, hands, feet, and calluses are generally black. Males are slightly more colorful and larger in size.

    content: '''
      <p>Vervet monkeys live in strongly territorial, multimale troops, which are generally about 60 individuals in size but can be as large as 140 animals. Females and young form the basic social unit. All males will transfer troops at least once in their lifetime after they reach sexual maturity. Switching troops can be dangerous, not only because of potential predators they may encounter but also because new troops do not always welcome newcomers. The hierarchical male-dominated social system in troops is responsible for controlling feeding, mating, fighting, survival, and even grooming. In the hierarchy, dominant individuals receive the most grooming, which is an important part of the vervet monkey’s life.</p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      <p>After a gestation period of 5.5 months, females give birth to a single young. Newborns spend the first week of life clinging to their mother’s stomach. After the third week, young will begin to move independently, attempting to play. When born, the young have black hair and a pink face, and they do not acquire adult coloration until three or four months of age.</p>
