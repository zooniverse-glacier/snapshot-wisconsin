  label: 'Lichtenstein\'s Hartebeest'
  description: '''
    The Lichtenstein\'s hartebeest is a large, high-shouldered antelope with long legs, a short neck, long, narrow face, and long, elongated ears. A reddish-brown saddle extends down to the base of the tail, contrasting with their white buttocks, and grades into pale flanks and underparts. The chin, tail tip, and stripe down foreleg are black. Both males and females have horns that are close together at the base, curve slightly forward and outward, and then point inward. The lower two-thirds of the horns have distinctive rings, and those of the female are more slender.

    content: '''
      <p>Male Lichtenstein\'s hartebeests defend sizable territories reaching some 2.5 square kilometers, within which herds of related females and young may reside semipermanently. Males use their dung to mark their territory and will fiercely defend it, with ensuing fights often resulting in one or both individuals wounded or even dead. As an antipredator mechanism, the territories may dissolve during the calving season, leading to larger herds and further protection. They are mostly active during the cooler periods of the day, in the morning, and late afternoon, but some nocturnal feeding is known to occur.</p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      <p>Female Lichtenstein\'s hartebeests become sexually mature between one and four years and will leave their parent herds to join the herd of a territorial male. Breeding is seasonal, with most births taking place during the dry season. After a gestation period of eight months, females give birth to a single calf.</p>
