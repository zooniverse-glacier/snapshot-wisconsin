    content: '''
      <p>The bushbuck is most active during part of the night and early morning, though they can be active throughout the 24-hour day. The bushbuck is the only solitary antelope. Each individual has a small home range that may overlap with those of other bushbucks, but they are not territorial nor confrontational. If they are startled or threatened, they freeze in one position, sink to the ground in an attempt to hide, or bound away. The bushbuck is an excellent jumper and is also able to swim. Their call resembles a series of hoarse or doglike barks.<p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      After a gestation period of 6 to 7 months, females give birth to a single calf. Young can be born at any time of the year, but in arid areas birth rates peak during the rainy season. After giving birth, a mother will clean and hide her newborn calf. She returns often to nurse the newborn and will also eat its dung to ensure there is no scent to attract predators. Once the calf is about four months old, it will accompany its mother out into the open to forage. They reach sexual maturity at the age of 1 year.
