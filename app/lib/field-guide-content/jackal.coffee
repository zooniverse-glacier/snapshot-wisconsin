  label: 'Side-striped Jackal'
  description: '''
    The side-striped jackal is easily distinguishable from its other jackal relatives. It has a slightly drabber light gray to tan coloration with a white tip on their otherwise black tail. The side-striped jackal is medium-sized and tends to have a white stripe that extends from the elbow to hip and black side stripes which are not always conspicuous. They have a relatively blunt muzzle and short, rounded ears. This species is sexually dimorphic in size, with males being larger than females.

    content: '''
      <p>Side-striped jackals are nocturnal, with peak activity times in the evening before dawn. Jackals are vocal, yipping, calling, and howling. They live singly or in pairs but can also form packs of up to 12 individuals. As a group, they will cooperatively hunt small antelopes. Mated pairs are territorial and mark and defend their territory.</p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      <p>After a gestation period of 57 to 70 days, side-striped jackals will give birth to three to six pups. It takes newborns about 10 days for their eyes to open, and for the first few weeks of their life, they remain hidden in the area where they were born. The mother will change den sites about every two weeks, to avoid predators finding the young. The pups are suckled and fed regurgitated food until they are about two months old. By three months, they begin following their parents, and by six months they are capable of hunting on their own.</p>
