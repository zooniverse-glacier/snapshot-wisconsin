      <p>African wildcats are solitary and primarily nocturnal. Female African wildcats defend a core area that sits within the territory of at least one male. Malesâ€™ territories will typically overlap with the ranges of three females. African wildcats have extremely sensitive hearing and are able to detect slight movements, which help make them such effective hunters.</p>
