    Occasionally, fires may be seen in these images, either with species or by itself. As in many biomes, fires on the savannah can be destructive, but also beneficial. Fire is a necessary part of life in Gorongosa, with many plant species requiring the occasional clearing of debris by fires in order to flourish; these in turn can provide better nutrition for grazing herbivores.
