  description: '''
    The waterbuck is a large, robust antelope. They have a shaggy, coarse, reddish-brown to brown-gray coat, which emits an oily secretion thought to be for waterproofing. They have large, rounded ears and white patches above the eyes, around the nose and mouth, and on the throat. A conspicuous feature of this antelope is the large white ring that in certain subspecies surrounds the base of the tail on the rump.

      <p>As its common name might suggest, the waterbuck is a good swimmer and flees into water if pursued by a predator. However, while they can swim it has been reported that they do not actually enjoy going into the water. Dominant male waterbucks (seven to nine years of age) will defend the largest and best territories. By the time a male reaches 10 years of age, he will generally be overthrown by a younger and stronger male. Groups of five to 10 females will wander over an expansive home range that encompasses the territories of several males.</p>
