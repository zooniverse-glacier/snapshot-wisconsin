    The African wild dog, also called the African painted dog, has a colorful coat with patches of red, black, brown, white, and yellow fur; large, batlike ears; and a bushy tail. Their face is primarily black, with a tan forehead. While African wild dogs resemble domestic dogs, these long-legged canines have only four toes per foot, unlike other dogs, which have five toes on their forefeet.
