      <p>Unlike the “nonpygmy” chameleons (Chamaeleoninae), which live high on trees and bushes, pygmy chameleons spend most of their life on the ground among leaf litter searching for food. Like other chameleons, this species uses its long, sticky tongue to capture prey. It is only at night that this species will climb up branches to avoid nocturnal predators such as shrews.</p>
