  description: '''
    Warthogs are members of the same family as domestic pigs but are much different in appearance. The warthog is a tough, sturdy gray hog with a broad face and white cheek whiskers. Its body appears hairless, though sparse bristles cover its figure, except for a dark erectile mane and a tail tuft. The warthog characteristically carries its long tail upright when it runs. Both sexes have curved upper tusks; males have tusks that are much larger. Both sexes also have “warts,” or thick protective pads, that appear on both sides of their head.

      <p>The diurnal warthog is one of the most abundant and successful herbivores in Africa. They generally live in family groups composed of a female and her young. Sometimes two related family groups will join together, but males normally live on their own, only joining a group to mate. Groups and solitary males typically stay within a home range 3 to 4 km wide but may travel over 7 km in a day. When eating they have developed a unique practice of kneeling on their calloused, padded knees as they consume grass. They also make use of their snouts and tusks when eating, using them to dig for bulbs, roots, and tubers. This warthog species creates burrows or takes them from other burrowing animals. They use the burrows for protection from predators, to sleep in, and as shelter for young.</p>

    title: 'Breeding'
    content: '''
      <p>Mating is partly determined by climate. Births generally occur between August and December. After a gestation period of about 5.5 months, a female will give birth in a burrow to two or three offspring per year. At about three weeks, the young will emerge from the burrow and begin feeding on grass. At about six months, the young are fully weaned.</p>
