  content: '''Use the buttons to the right of the photo to pick any animal that you see in the photo; then, select the appropriate number and behavior of the animals.

  title: 'Use the buttons to narrow down options',
  content: '''If you don’t immediately recognize an animal, you can use the buttons above the animal list (pattern, color, etc.) to narrow down your choices and figure out what you’re looking at. For most animals, the guide also offers a useful comparison with other species that are commonly confused with that animal.''',

  title: '''Don’t worry if you’re not 100% sure''',
  content: '''If you see an animal, please mark it, even if you’re not sure, or have no idea what it is! Many people will see each photo, so errors will be filtered out. Additionally, if there is a lot of disagreement about what is in the photo, one of the researchers will probably take a look. This is why there is no “I don’t know” button. Please just take your best guess!''',
